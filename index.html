            The main goal of the project is to understand how the Angular + Asp.Net Core bundle works. Difficulties during the project: routing and insufficient knowledge of the HTTP protocol, which led to the incorrect operation of my application.
            However, with an in-depth study of additional material,
            understanding how the client part sends requests to the server and how data can be processed in a web application, thanks to which fundamental problems were solved.
            As a result, the practice prompted me to study a number of other important things, such as the architecture of web applications, their optimization and writing clean code, as well as testing it.</p>
